### information on our projet 

## Description

our project aims to create a program that will automatically manage the temperature and humidity of a plant.
it is with this in mind that we have sought to know how to present it. Thus, we established a set of things which we will be essential for the proper functioning of our project, such as knowing how we were going to divide the tasks and then trying to agree on how to write the code.we first wrote the temperature and humidity code on arduino after we tried to write the AI ​​code that will regulate the temperature via the PID but this turned out to be a bit problematic since during our different researches in order to realize a code that works in the java language was impossible, we decided to do it in python which is one of the best languages ​​in terms of artificial intelligence.

## Equipment

     -an arduino card
     -Pressure regulator
     -LCD screen
     -Temperature and humidity sensor
     -a pot
     -a plant
     -an internal battery
     
## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages:

our project aims to help people in their daily life because we know very well that we often forget to water our plants and when it dies it is already too late. so we thought about how to fix it.
advantages are :
     
     -economic
     -futuristic
     -smart
